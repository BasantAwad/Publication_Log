    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in biomedical engineering combining tissue engineering with medical devices. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in scalability compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for medical devices and open new directions for future research in biomedical engineering.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses medical devices in biomedical engineering. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in biomechanics.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining tissue engineering with biomechanics,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 38\% improvement in latency compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.05).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in biomedical engineering, opening new
    directions including tissue engineering applications.
