    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in biomedical engineering combining medical devices with biomaterials. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in efficiency compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for medical devices and open new directions for future research in biomedical engineering.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses biomechanics in biomedical engineering. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in biomaterials.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining biomaterials with biomechanics,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 74\% improvement in F1 score compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.04).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in biomedical engineering, opening new
    directions including biomechanics applications.
