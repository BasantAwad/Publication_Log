    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in quantum computing combining qubits with error correction. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in scalability compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for quantum algorithms and open new directions for future research in quantum computing.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses qubits in quantum computing. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in qubits.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining qubits with quantum algorithms,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 22\% improvement in accuracy compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.04).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in quantum computing, opening new
    directions including qubits applications.
