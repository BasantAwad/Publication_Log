    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in biomedical engineering using biomaterials and biomaterials. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for medical devices and open new directions for future research in biomedical engineering.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses biomechanics in biomedical engineering. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in medical devices.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining biomaterials with tissue engineering,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 55\% improvement in accuracy compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.01).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in biomedical engineering, opening new
    directions including tissue engineering applications.
