    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in cybersecurity through novel application of cryptography. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in scalability compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for cryptography and open new directions for future research in cybersecurity.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses network security in cybersecurity. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in penetration testing.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining cryptography with threat intelligence,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 29\% improvement in accuracy compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.04).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in cybersecurity, opening new
    directions including network security applications.
