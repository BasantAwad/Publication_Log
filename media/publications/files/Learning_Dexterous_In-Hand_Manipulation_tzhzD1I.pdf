    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in robotics combining human-robot interaction with robot learning. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for human-robot interaction and open new directions for future research in robotics.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses robot learning in robotics. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in swarm robotics.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining swarm robotics with robot learning,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 67\% improvement in accuracy compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.02).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in robotics, opening new
    directions including robot learning applications.
