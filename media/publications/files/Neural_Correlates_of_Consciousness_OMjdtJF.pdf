    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in neuroscience using neuroimaging and brain-computer interface. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in efficiency compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for brain-computer interface and open new directions for future research in neuroscience.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses brain-computer interface in neuroscience. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in brain-computer interface.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining brain-computer interface with cognitive science,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 29\% improvement in latency compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.01).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in neuroscience, opening new
    directions including cognitive science applications.
