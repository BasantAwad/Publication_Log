    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in biomedical engineering combining biomechanics with biomechanics. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in efficiency compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for medical devices and open new directions for future research in biomedical engineering.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses medical devices in biomedical engineering. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in biomaterials.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining tissue engineering with biomaterials,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 76\% improvement in accuracy compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.02).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in biomedical engineering, opening new
    directions including tissue engineering applications.
