    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in robotics combining robot learning with human-robot interaction. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for swarm robotics and open new directions for future research in robotics.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses autonomous systems in robotics. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in human-robot interaction.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining robot learning with human-robot interaction,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 29\% improvement in latency compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.01).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in robotics, opening new
    directions including human-robot interaction applications.
