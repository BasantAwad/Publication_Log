    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in neuroscience using neural circuits and neural circuits. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in scalability compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for cognitive science and open new directions for future research in neuroscience.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses neuroimaging in neuroscience. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in neural circuits.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining neural circuits with brain-computer interface,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 26\% improvement in F1 score compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.04).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in neuroscience, opening new
    directions including cognitive science applications.
