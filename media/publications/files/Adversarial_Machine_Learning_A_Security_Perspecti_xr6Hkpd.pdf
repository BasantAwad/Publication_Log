    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in cybersecurity through novel application of network security. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for threat intelligence and open new directions for future research in cybersecurity.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses penetration testing in cybersecurity. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in threat intelligence.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining threat intelligence with cryptography,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 73\% improvement in F1 score compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.02).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in cybersecurity, opening new
    directions including penetration testing applications.
