    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in biomedical engineering combining biomaterials with medical devices. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in scalability compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for medical devices and open new directions for future research in biomedical engineering.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses biomechanics in biomedical engineering. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in biomaterials.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining tissue engineering with biomechanics,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 13\% improvement in F1 score compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.04).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in biomedical engineering, opening new
    directions including biomaterials applications.
