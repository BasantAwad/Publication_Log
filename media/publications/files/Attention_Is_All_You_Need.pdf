    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses NLP in machine learning. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in deep learning.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining deep learning with neural networks,
    implemented using TensorFlow.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 20\% improvement in accuracy compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.03).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in machine learning, opening new
    directions including computer vision applications.
