    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in climate science combining climate modeling with renewables. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for renewables and open new directions for future research in climate science.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses global warming in climate science. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in carbon capture.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining global warming with renewables,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 45\% improvement in accuracy compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.05).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in climate science, opening new
    directions including global warming applications.
