    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in quantum computing through novel application of qubits. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in scalability compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for qubits and open new directions for future research in quantum computing.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses error correction in quantum computing. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in quantum supremacy.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining qubits with quantum algorithms,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 33\% improvement in latency compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.02).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in quantum computing, opening new
    directions including error correction applications.
