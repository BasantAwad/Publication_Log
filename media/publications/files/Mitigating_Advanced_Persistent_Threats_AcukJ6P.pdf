    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in cybersecurity through novel application of threat intelligence. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for network security and open new directions for future research in cybersecurity.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses penetration testing in cybersecurity. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in cryptography.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining threat intelligence with penetration testing,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 59\% improvement in F1 score compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.02).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in cybersecurity, opening new
    directions including cryptography applications.
