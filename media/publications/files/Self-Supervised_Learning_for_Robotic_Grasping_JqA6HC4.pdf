    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in robotics using swarm robotics and autonomous systems. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for robot learning and open new directions for future research in robotics.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses robot learning in robotics. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in autonomous systems.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining human-robot interaction with robot learning,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 21\% improvement in latency compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.05).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in robotics, opening new
    directions including swarm robotics applications.
