    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in cybersecurity combining penetration testing with network security. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for network security and open new directions for future research in cybersecurity.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses penetration testing in cybersecurity. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in penetration testing.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining threat intelligence with cryptography,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 50\% improvement in latency compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.03).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in cybersecurity, opening new
    directions including threat intelligence applications.
