    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in climate science combining carbon capture with renewables. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for climate modeling and open new directions for future research in climate science.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses climate modeling in climate science. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in renewables.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining renewables with renewables,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 6\% improvement in accuracy compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.02).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in climate science, opening new
    directions including renewables applications.
