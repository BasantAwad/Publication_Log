    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in neuroscience using brain-computer interface and neuroimaging. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for cognitive science and open new directions for future research in neuroscience.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses brain-computer interface in neuroscience. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in neural circuits.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining neural circuits with neuroimaging,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 6\% improvement in accuracy compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.03).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in neuroscience, opening new
    directions including cognitive science applications.
