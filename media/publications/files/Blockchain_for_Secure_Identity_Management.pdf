    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in cybersecurity through novel application of penetration testing. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for threat intelligence and open new directions for future research in cybersecurity.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses threat intelligence in cybersecurity. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in cryptography.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining cryptography with network security,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 38\% improvement in F1 score compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.02).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in cybersecurity, opening new
    directions including cryptography applications.
