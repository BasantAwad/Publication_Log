    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in neuroscience using cognitive science and brain-computer interface. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for brain-computer interface and open new directions for future research in neuroscience.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses cognitive science in neuroscience. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in cognitive science.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining brain-computer interface with neuroimaging,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 52\% improvement in accuracy compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.05).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in neuroscience, opening new
    directions including neuroimaging applications.
