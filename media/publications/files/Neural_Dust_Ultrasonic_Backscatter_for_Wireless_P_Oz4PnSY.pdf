    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in biomedical engineering combining medical devices with biomaterials. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for biomechanics and open new directions for future research in biomedical engineering.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses biomechanics in biomedical engineering. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in tissue engineering.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining tissue engineering with tissue engineering,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 15\% improvement in accuracy compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.04).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in biomedical engineering, opening new
    directions including biomaterials applications.
