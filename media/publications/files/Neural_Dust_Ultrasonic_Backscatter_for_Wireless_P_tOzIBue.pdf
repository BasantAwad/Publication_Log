    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in biomedical engineering using tissue engineering and biomechanics. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in efficiency compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for biomaterials and open new directions for future research in biomedical engineering.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses tissue engineering in biomedical engineering. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in tissue engineering.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining tissue engineering with medical devices,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 57\% improvement in F1 score compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.05).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in biomedical engineering, opening new
    directions including tissue engineering applications.
