    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in cybersecurity combining penetration testing with threat intelligence. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in efficiency compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for cryptography and open new directions for future research in cybersecurity.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses network security in cybersecurity. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in network security.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining network security with network security,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 77\% improvement in F1 score compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.03).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in cybersecurity, opening new
    directions including cryptography applications.
