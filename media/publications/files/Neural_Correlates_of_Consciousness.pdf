    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in neuroscience combining brain-computer interface with cognitive science. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in scalability compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for neuroimaging and open new directions for future research in neuroscience.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses brain-computer interface in neuroscience. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in cognitive science.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining brain-computer interface with neural circuits,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 25\% improvement in F1 score compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.03).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in neuroscience, opening new
    directions including cognitive science applications.
