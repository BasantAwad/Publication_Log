    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in cybersecurity using penetration testing and network security. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in scalability compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for cryptography and open new directions for future research in cybersecurity.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses threat intelligence in cybersecurity. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in threat intelligence.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining penetration testing with threat intelligence,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 23\% improvement in latency compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.02).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in cybersecurity, opening new
    directions including penetration testing applications.
