    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in cybersecurity using network security and penetration testing. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in efficiency compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for penetration testing and open new directions for future research in cybersecurity.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses cryptography in cybersecurity. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in network security.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining penetration testing with network security,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 71\% improvement in accuracy compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.04).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in cybersecurity, opening new
    directions including network security applications.
