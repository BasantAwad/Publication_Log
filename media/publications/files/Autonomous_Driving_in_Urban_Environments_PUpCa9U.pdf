    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in robotics through novel application of human-robot interaction. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for autonomous systems and open new directions for future research in robotics.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses robot learning in robotics. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in human-robot interaction.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining robot learning with human-robot interaction,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 31\% improvement in F1 score compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.04).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in robotics, opening new
    directions including autonomous systems applications.
