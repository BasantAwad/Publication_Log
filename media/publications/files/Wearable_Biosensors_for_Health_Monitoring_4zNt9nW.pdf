    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in biomedical engineering using biomechanics and biomaterials. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for biomaterials and open new directions for future research in biomedical engineering.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses biomechanics in biomedical engineering. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in biomechanics.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining medical devices with tissue engineering,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 7\% improvement in latency compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.03).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in biomedical engineering, opening new
    directions including biomechanics applications.
