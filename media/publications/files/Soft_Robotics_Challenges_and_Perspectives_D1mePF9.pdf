    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in robotics combining human-robot interaction with swarm robotics. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in scalability compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for swarm robotics and open new directions for future research in robotics.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses robot learning in robotics. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in human-robot interaction.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining human-robot interaction with human-robot interaction,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 40\% improvement in accuracy compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.05).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in robotics, opening new
    directions including human-robot interaction applications.
