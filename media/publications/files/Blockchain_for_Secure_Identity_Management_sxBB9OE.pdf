    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in cybersecurity using network security and penetration testing. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in scalability compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for threat intelligence and open new directions for future research in cybersecurity.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses cryptography in cybersecurity. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in cryptography.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining network security with penetration testing,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 65\% improvement in F1 score compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.03).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in cybersecurity, opening new
    directions including penetration testing applications.
