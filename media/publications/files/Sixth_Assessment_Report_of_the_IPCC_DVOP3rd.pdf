    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in climate science through novel application of renewables. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in scalability compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for global warming and open new directions for future research in climate science.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses global warming in climate science. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in carbon capture.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining climate modeling with carbon capture,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 41\% improvement in accuracy compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.04).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in climate science, opening new
    directions including carbon capture applications.
