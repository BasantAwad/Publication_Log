    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in biomedical engineering through novel application of biomaterials. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for biomaterials and open new directions for future research in biomedical engineering.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses tissue engineering in biomedical engineering. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in biomechanics.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining medical devices with biomechanics,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 75\% improvement in accuracy compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.01).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in biomedical engineering, opening new
    directions including medical devices applications.
