    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in neuroscience through novel application of brain-computer interface. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for neural circuits and open new directions for future research in neuroscience.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses neuroimaging in neuroscience. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in neuroimaging.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining brain-computer interface with brain-computer interface,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 73\% improvement in accuracy compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.05).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in neuroscience, opening new
    directions including cognitive science applications.
