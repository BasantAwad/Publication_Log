    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in biomedical engineering using tissue engineering and biomechanics. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in scalability compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for tissue engineering and open new directions for future research in biomedical engineering.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses biomaterials in biomedical engineering. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in biomaterials.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining tissue engineering with tissue engineering,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 68\% improvement in accuracy compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.02).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in biomedical engineering, opening new
    directions including medical devices applications.
