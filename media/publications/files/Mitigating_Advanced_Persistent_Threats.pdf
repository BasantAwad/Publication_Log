    \section{Abstract}
    This study addresses critical challenges in cybersecurity using penetration testing and threat intelligence. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in scalability compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for cryptography and open new directions for future research in cybersecurity.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    This paper addresses network security in cybersecurity. Recent advances have enabled new approaches, but
    limitations remain in cryptography.
    
    \section{Methods}
    We developed a novel approach combining cryptography with threat intelligence,
    implemented using Qiskit.
    
    \section{Results}
    Our evaluation shows 19\% improvement in accuracy compared to
    existing techniques (p<0.03).
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    These findings demonstrate significant advances in cybersecurity, opening new
    directions including threat intelligence applications.
